This project involves creating a browser-based word guessing game called "Phrase Hunter" using JavaScript and OOP. 

The game randomly selects a hidden phrase, which the player guesses by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard. The code uses two JavaScript classes: a Game class for managing the game and a Phrase class to create an array of Phrase objects.

The game splits the phrase into letters and displays them on the gameboard. Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares it to the random phrase, displaying the chosen letters if they match. The player can continue selecting letters until they guess the phrase (and win) or make five incorrect guesses (and lose). The game also includes winning and losing screens.

Finally, the player can only guess each letter once, after which the letter will be disabled on the onscreen keyboard. This project makes for a great portfolio piece and provides a good understanding of OOP principles.
